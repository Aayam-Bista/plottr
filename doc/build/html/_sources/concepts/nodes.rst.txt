Nodes and Flowcharts
====================

The basic concept of modular data analyis as we use it in plottr consists of `Nodes` that are connected directionally to form a `Flowchart`. This terminology is adopted from the great `pyqtgraph <https://www.pyqtgraph.org>`_ project; we currently use their `Node` and `Flowchart` API under the hood as well.
